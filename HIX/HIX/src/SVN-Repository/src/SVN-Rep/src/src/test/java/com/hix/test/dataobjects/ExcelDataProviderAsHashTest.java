	 * Before running the test, we want to initialize our global variables The path name is set to "src/test/resource"
	 * since we already knew the parent directory, "Bluefin-Core". which is the directory where this test case started.
	 * So we don't have to specify the whole path name here. The fileName is set to the name of the Excel workbook about
	 * to read. With the pathName and fileName the ExcelDataProvider construtor will construct a full qualified path
	 * name to the file to be read.
	 * 
	 * After we instantiated the ExcelDataProvider, we can use it to invoke "getAllRowsAsHashTable". For the function to
	 * work, you have to pass in the "user-defined-data-type" so it can reverse engineer it and know exactly what kind
	 * of data it should assign to each field while reading the data from the Excel worksheet.
	 * 
	 * The end results are assigned back to the hashTable for further exploring.
	 * 
	 * Reading data from the Excelsheet could generate several exception. For example, file not found, cannot read from
	 * file, invalid value...
	 * 
	 * @throws Exception
	 *             if file reading errors.
